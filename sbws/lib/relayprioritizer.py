        The relays that were measured more recently get lower priority (last in
        the list, higher priority number).

        Optionally, the relays which measurements failed can be prioritized
        (first in the list).
        However, unstable relays that fail often to be measured, might fail
        again and stable relays will get measured only when their measurements
        become old enough.
        The opposite might be more suitable: give lower priority to the relays
        that are unstable, to don't spend time measuring relays that might fail
        to be measured.

            In a future refactor, instead of having a static fraction of relays
            to be measured, this method could be call when it's known that
            there're X number of new relays in the network.

        Since measurements made before than X days ago (too old) are not
        considered, and the initial list of past measurements is only filtered
        when the scanner starts, it's needed to filter here again to discard
        those measurements.
