    '''
    Connect to **dest* over the given **circ_id** using the given Requests
    **session**. Make sure the destination seems usable. Return True and a
    dictionary of helpful information if we connected and the destination is
    usable.  Otherwise return False and a string stating what the issue is.

    This function has two effects, and which one is the "side effect" depends
    on your goal.

    1. It creates a stream to the destination. It persists in the requests
    library **session** object so future requests use the same stream.
    Therefore, the primary effect of this function could be to open a
    connection to the destination that measurements can be made over the given
    **circ_id**, which makes the usability checks a side effect (yet important
    sanity check).

    2. It determines if a destination is usable. Therefore, the primary effect
    of this function could be to perform the usability checks and return the
    results of those checks, which makes the persistent stream a side effect
    that we don't care about.

    As of the time of writing, you'll find that sbws/core/scanner.py uses this
    function in order to obtain that stream over which to perform measurements.
    You will also find in sbws/lib/destination.py (this file) this function
    being used to determine if a Destination is usable. The first relies on the
    persistent stream side effect, the second ignores it (and in fact throws it
    away when it closes the circuit).

    :param dest Destination: the place to which we should connect
    :param circ_id str: the circuit we should connect over
    :param session Session: the Requests library session object to use to make
        the connection.
    :param cont Controller: them Stem library controller controlling Tor
    :returns: True and a dictionary if everything is in order and measurements
        should commence.  False and an error string otherwise.
