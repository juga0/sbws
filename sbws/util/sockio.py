    Read from the blocking socket **s** until nothing can be read anymore or
    until a b'\n' is seen.

    If max_len is specified, then that's the maximum number of characters that
    will be returned, even if a newline is not read yet.

    This function can only handle characters that can be represented as a
    single byte in utf8.

    :param socket.socket s: Blocking socket to read from
    :param int max_len: Maximum number of bytes to read, not including a
        tailing newline
    :raises UnicodeDecodeError: If any byte is not a valid utf8 byte
    :returns: Everything read up until a newline as a str and with a maximum
        length of **max_len**. If nothing could be read, returns None. If a
        newline is the first character, returns an empty str.
