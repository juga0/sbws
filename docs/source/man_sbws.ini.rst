  reset_bw_ipv4_changes = {on, off}
    Whether or not to reset the bandwidth measurements when the relay's IP
    address changes. If it changes, we only consider results for the relay that
    we obtained while the relay was located at its most recent IP address.
    (Default: on)

  v3bw_dname = STR
    Directory where sbws stores the bandwidth list files.
    These are the files to be read by the Tor Directory Authorities.
    (Default: ~/.sbws/v3bw)
  v3bw_fname = STR

    File path to store the timestamp when the scanner was last started.
    (Default: ~/.sbws/started_at)
  log_dname = STR
    Directory where to store log files when logging to files is enabled.
    (Default ~/.sbws/log)

destinations

tor
  datadir = STR
    sbws' owned tor directory. (Default: ~/.sbws/tor)
  control_socket = STR

    Limits on what download times are too fast/slow/etc. (Default: 6)
  download_max = INT
    Limits on what download times are too fast/slow/etc. (Default: 10)
  num_rtts = INT
    How many RTT measurements to make. (Default: 10)
  num_downloads = INT
    Number of downloads with acceptable times we must have for a relay before
    moving on. (Default: 5)
  initial_read_request = INT
    The number of bytes to initially request from the server. (Default: 16384)
  measurement_threads = INT
    How many measurements to make in parallel. (Default: 3)
  min_download_size = INT
    Minimum number of bytes we should ever try to download in a measurement.
    (Default: 1)
  max_download_size = INT
    Maximum number of bytes we should ever try to download in a measurement.
    (Default: 1073741824) 1073741824 == 1 GiB

relayprioritizer
  measure_authorities = {on, off}
    Whether or not to measure authorities. (Default: off)
  fraction_relays = FLOAT
    The target fraction of best priority relays we would like to return.
    0.05 is 5%. In a 7000 relay network, 5% is 350 relays. (Default: 0.05)
  min_relays = INT
    The minimum number of best priority relays we are willing to return.
    (Default: 50)

cleanup
  stale_days = INT
    After this many days, compress data files. (Default: 10)
  rotten_days = INT
    After this many days, delete data files. (Default: 90)

logging
  to_file = {yes, no}
    Whether or not to log to a rotating file the directory paths.log_dname.
    (Default: no)

  to_file_max_bytes = INT
    If logging to file, how large (in bytes) should the file be allowed to get

    backups is zero, never rotate the log file. (Default: 10485760)
