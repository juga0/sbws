Simple Bandwidth Scanner (called `sbws`) is a Tor bandwidth scanner that
produces bandwidth files to be used by Directory Authorities.

The scanner builds two hop circuits consisting of the relay being measured and
a fast exit. Over these circuits it measures bandwidth and store the results.

The generator read the measurement results, scales them using torflow's
scaling method and creates the bandwidth file.

**WARNING**: This software is intended to be run by researchers using a test
Tor network, such as chutney or shadow, or by the Tor bandwidth authorities
on the public Tor network.
Please do not run this software on the public Tor network unless you are one
of the Tor bandwidth authorities, to avoid creating unnecessary traffic.
